I’m Mohammad Amin, a recent graduate of the University of Tehran with a master’s degree in mechanical engineering.\nMy research interests include Auxetic Mechanical Structures, Machine Vision, Autoencoders, and Optimization. I’d rather be called “Nima” as I go by this among my friends!\nI’m passionate about using my knowledge to make a positive impact on society. In the future, I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science and work on projects involving machine learning since this greatly impacts human lives. I’d like to have my own contributions.\nWhen not working on my research, I enjoy playing chess on chess.com, reading Tim Urban’s blog, or listening to Lex Fridman’s podcasts.\nOn this site, you’ll find a list of my publications, notable projects, my CV, and a simple blog where I share my thoughts on computer science, life, and self-improvement."
